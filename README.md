# Hermit - uniform tooling for Linux and Mac [![CI](https://github.com/cashapp/hermit/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cashapp/hermit/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Hermit installs tools for software projects in self-contained, isolated sets, so your team, your contributors, and your CI have the same consistent tooling.

See https://cashapp.github.io/hermit for full documentation.
