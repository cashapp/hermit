# Supported SDKs

As of early 2021 Hermit has support for the following language SDKs.

| SDK              | Status
|------------------|------------------------
| [Crystal](https://github.com/cashapp/hermit-packages/blob/master/crystal.hcl) | Crystal is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language with a Ruby-inspired syntax.
| [Elm](https://github.com/cashapp/hermit-packages/blob/master/elm.hcl) | Elm is distributed as a single binary, so everything works as you would expect!
| [Flutter (Dart)](https://github.com/cashapp/hermit-packages/blob/master/flutter.hcl) | Flutter is available, though not well tested.
| [GraalVM](https://github.com/cashapp/hermit-packages/blob/master/graalvm.hcl) | GraalVM is supported and reasonably well tested.
| [Go](https://github.com/cashapp/hermit-packages/blob/master/go.hcl) | Hermitised Go is isolated, though uses the global Go cache (`~/go`) for performance/utilisation considerations. `${GOBIN}` is set to `${HERMIT_ENV}/.hermit/go/bin` and is included in the `${PATH}`.
| [Haskell (GHC)](https://github.com/cashapp/hermit-packages/blob/master/ghc.hcl) | GHC and [Cabal](https://github.com/cashapp/hermit-packages/blob/master/cabal.hcl) are both available though not well tested.
| [Java](https://github.com/cashapp/hermit-packages/blob/master/openjdk.hcl) | Java (OpenJDK) is supported and well tested, including [Zulu](https://www.azul.com/downloads/) builds.
| [Kotlin](https://github.com/cashapp/hermit-packages/blob/master/kotlin.hcl) | Kotlin is supported and well tested.
| [Node](https://github.com/cashapp/hermit-packages/blob/master/node.hcl) | Packages are completely isolated within the Hermit environment. Global packages (`npm install -g`) are installed into `${HERMIT_ENV}/.hermit/node` while local packages are installed in `${HERMIT_ENV}/node_modules`. `bin` directories for both global and local packages are added to the `${PATH}`.
| [Python](https://github.com/cashapp/hermit-packages/blob/master/python3.hcl) | Python is fully supported and isolated. Python packages installed within an active Hermit environment will be located in `${HERMIT_ENV}/.hermit/python` and `${HERMIT_ENV}/.hermit/python/bin` is added to the `${PATH}`.
| [Rust](https://github.com/cashapp/hermit-packages/blob/master/rust.hcl) | Rust stable and nightly are both supported along with all standard tooling. Nightly will be updated daily.
| [TinyGo](https://github.com/cashapp/hermit-packages/blob/master/tinygo.hcl) | A Go Compiler For Small Places.
| [Zig](https://github.com/cashapp/hermit-packages/blob/master/zig.hcl) | Zig is supported and works as expected, though not well tested.
