Each Hermit package manifest is a nested structure containing
OS/architecture-specific configuration.

This is reference documentation for the manifest structure. Refer to the
[tutorial](../tutorial) for a guided introduction and
[existing manifests](https://github.com/cashapp/hermit-packages) for examples.
